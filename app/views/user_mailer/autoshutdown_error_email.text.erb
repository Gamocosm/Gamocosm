There was an error trying to check/autoshutdown your server "<%= @server.name %>"

We recommend you check your servers on Gamocosm (<%= root_url %>) and Digital Ocean (<%= digital_ocean_control_panel_link %>).

Please ensure that `enable-query=true` is set in your `server.properties`.

There may be more information under "Server Logs" on your server on Gamocosm.

If you could submit a bug report on GitHub (<%= issues_link %>), that would be greatly appreciated.

We sincerely apologize for the inconvenience!
