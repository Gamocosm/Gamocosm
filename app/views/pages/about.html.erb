		<h2>Basic Information</h2>
		<dl class="faq">
			<dt>How much does per hour hosting cost?</dt>
			<dd>
				Let's say you and your friends play 2 hours a day, every day.
				That's ~60 hours a month.
				Typically, private servers only need 1GB-2GB of RAM.
				On <%= render_digital_ocean_referral_link('%s (%s)', 'Digital Ocean', digital_ocean_index_path, digital_ocean_index_no_ref_path) %>, this is 0.7-1.5 <em>cents</em> an hour (<%= render_digital_ocean_referral_link('%s, %s', 'pricing', digital_ocean_pricing_path, digital_ocean_pricing_no_ref_path) %>), or <strong>~$0.40-$0.80 a month</strong>.
			</dd>
			<dt>What is Digital Ocean?</dt>
			<dd>
				Digital Ocean is a general purpose cloud hosting provider.
				They host a lot of servers, not just for Minecraft, so their prices are about as low as servers get.
				A lot of developers/companies use Digital Ocean for their websites and apps; they're not just another Minecraft hosting startup.
				Running Minecraft on Digital Ocean is not only cheap, but you have unrestricted access to the server!
				It's more work to set up and manage a server on Digital Ocean yourself, but Gamocosm tries to bridge that gap.
			</dd>
			<dt>If Digital Ocean is hosting the server, what is Gamocosm doing?</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>Gamocosm sets up your server.
				Digital Ocean provides a bare linux server, so you/Gamocosm needs to install and configure it to be a ready, secure Minecraft server.
				If you're interested, check this <%= link_to 'wiki page', wiki_server_additional_info_path %> for more info on the setup.</p>

				<p><strong>Secondly, Digital Ocean continues charging you when you <em>just</em> stop a server</strong>, because its resources are still allocated.
				When you turn off a server on Gamocosm, it snapshots (backs up), and destroys your server.
				When you turn on a server, Gamocosm recreates it from the snapshot.
				This way, you only pay when the server is in use.</p>
			</dd>
			<dt>That's a little confusing</dt>
			<dd>
				Just make sure you click "Turn off" on Gamocosm when you're done playing!
			</dd>
			<dt>Anything else I should know?</dt>
			<dd>
				Gamocosm just automates the general process of running Minecraft on a cloud server - you have <em>full access</em> to a Linux machine; you can do whatever you want with it!
				You can <%= link_to 'SSH, FTP', wiki_ftp_ssh_path %>, install mods, and even use entirely <%= link_to 'custom servers', wiki_minecraft_versions_path %>!

		<h2>FAQs</h2>
		<dl class="faq">
			<dt>There's a bug!</dt>
			<dd>Do one of the following:<ul>
				<li>Check the <%= link_to 'Troubleshooting page', wiki_troubleshooting_path %> on the wiki</li>
				<li>File an <%= link_to 'issue on GitHub', issues_path %></li>
				<li>Ask a question on <%= link_to 'Gitter chat', external_gitter_path %></li>
				<li>Developers may be online on IRC at <code>#gamocosm</code> on <code>irc.esper.net</code>
			</ul></dd>

			<dt>Why does it take so long to start/stop a server?</dt>
			<dd>Cloud hosting providers continue to charge you when your server is off, because resources are still allocated for you.
			What you can do is backup the server, destroy it, and restore the server from the backup the next time you need it.
			This is one of the things Gamocosm does for you automatically. It is a tradeoff so you can have the insanely low prices.
			Estimate: 2 minutes start time (5+ minutes first time creating server).
			Read more about how this works in the <%= link_to 'About page', about_path %>.
			</dd>

			<dt>What's the difference between the domain and IP address?</dt>
			<dd>
				An IP address locates an actual server.
				Domains map to IP addresses, and are used because they're easier to remember.
				Occasionally, the IP of your server may change, but the domain we create for your servers will always be the same.
				However, sometimes the old IP is cached somewhere along the pipeline, so you have to enter the IP directly.
			</dd>

			<dt>Where is Minecraft on my server?</dt>
			<dd>Your home directory is <code>/home/mcuser/</code>.
			Sometimes this is shortened as a tilda (<code>~</code>).
			Minecraft is installed in <code>~/minecraft/</code></dd>

			<dt>How do I edit the ops or whitelist?</dt>
			<dd><ul>
				<li>If there is already an operator on the server, he can op/deop/whitelist other players in chat; otherwise</li>
				<li>Start the Minecraft server</li>
				<li>Under "Send Command to Server", <code>op</code>, <code>deop</code>, or <code>whitelist add/remove</code> players</li>
			</ul></dd>

			<dt>Where are my server backups?</dt>
			<dd>Backups are saved on your server in <code>~/minecraft/backups/</code>.
			However, it is recommended that you download backups (e.g. via FTP) from time to time,
			and keep your own local backups</dd>

			<dt>How do I FTP or SSH?</dt>
			<dd>See this <%= link_to 'wiki page', wiki_ftp_ssh_path %>.</dd>

			<dt>How do I run different Minecraft versions, modded, or custom servers (e.g. Bukkit, Forge, Cuberite)?</dt>
			<dd>See this <%= link_to 'wiki page', wiki_minecraft_versions_path %></dd>

			<dt>Why/how do I set up Gamocosm with Digital Ocean?</dt>
			<dd>See <%= link_to 'this page', digital_ocean_setup_path %></dd>

			<dt>How do I resize a server?</dt>
			<dd>
				To increase the size:
				<ul>
					<li>Stop the server</li>
					<li>Under the "Advanced" tab, update "Digital Ocean size slug" to be one of [<%= @do_sizes.map { |x| x.slug }.join(', ') %>]</li>
					<li>Start the server</li>
				</ul>
				To decrease the size, you need to FTP or SSH to backup any files you want to keep (such as your world folder), and create a new server.
				Upload your files back on the server.
			</dd>

			<dt>What do you mean "Autoshutdown is experimental"?</dt>
			<dd>
				<p>
				Gamocosm works with a lot of infrastructure behind the scenes; a lot can go wrong that is and isn't Gamocosm's fault (we're working hard to iron out our bugs!).
				Autoshutdown is an especially tricky feature, and we can't guarantee that all cases are covered - especially when thing's outside Gamocosm's control go wrong.
				As much as feasible has been tested, but you shouldn't rely on it to shutdown your server before a month long hiatus, for example.
				On the other hand, if you play daily and check your email (for when Gamocosm tries to notify you that something went wrong), it's not really a problem if your server doesn't shut down one day.
				</p>
				<p>
				Why did we introduce this experimental feature?
				Because it has been requested the most! :P
				We - or more accurately I xD - don't have the manpower to test and push an enterprise-grade feature like this.
				The only way I can polish it is with user feedback and support.
				</p>
			</dd>

			<dt>Gamocosm got an error pinging/querying my server</dt>
			<dd>
				<ul>
					<li>Ensure <code>enable-query</code> is set in your <code>server.properties</code></li>
					<li>Ensure port 25565 is open to UDP (<code>(sudo) firewall-cmd --add-port=25565/udp</code> and <code>(sudo) firewall-cmd --permanent --add-port=25565/udp</code>)
				</ul>
				Both of these are done automatically on new servers, but you will have to do this manually for servers created before the autoshutdown update

		<h2>Donations/Internet Freedom</h2>
		<p>
			At this time, I do not feel worthy of donations :P
			If possible, using <%= link_to 'Gamocosm\'s referral link for Digital Ocean', digital_ocean_index_path %>
			to subsidize server costs is appreciated.
			However, if you wish to support, I encourage everyone to support internet freedom groups such as Wikipedia.
			<strong>It's easy to gloss over their donation requests, but it is really important that we don't take them for granted!</strong>
		</p>
		<p>
			After doing my own research, I personally set up monthly donations to the following organizations:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="https://donate.mozilla.org">Mozilla</a> (consider trying the new <a href="https://www.mozilla.org">Firefox</a>!)</li>
				<li><a href="https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Ways_to_Give">Wikipedia/Wikimedia Foundation</a></li>
				<li><a href="https://www.eff.org">Electronic Frontier Foundation</a> (international non-profit digital rights group)</li>
				<li><a href="https://freepress.net">Free Press.net</a> (they fight for Net Neutrality! I'm Canadian but it's still important!)</li>
			</ul>
			Really, looking at the big picture, it costs almost nothing.
			It only feels like a lot because "I don't have to" - bystander effect.
		</p>

		I personally like these quotes (<strong>tl;dr? Fight the good fight! Fighto!</strong>):
			<blockquote>

					is no different than saying you don't care about free speech because you have nothing to say.
